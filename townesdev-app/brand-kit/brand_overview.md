- **Secondary Mark:** Wordmark `Townes.dev` in Inter or Space Grotesk, all caps.
- **Usage Rules:**
  - Maintain clear space equal to the lighthouse width.
  - Do not distort, recolor, or apply shadows to the icon.
  - Use the _light version_ on dark backgrounds, and _dark version_ on light backgrounds.

### 🔠 Typography

| Type      | Font           | Usage                             |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Primary   | Inter          | Headings, body text, README files |

- Use **all caps** for main headings (TOWNESDEV, PROJECT TITLES).
- Use **sentence case** for explanatory text.
- Keep spacing generous — structure is a visual principle.

---

### 🧭 Brand Voice

**Tone:** calm, grounded, clear, precise.  
**Style:** technical yet approachable — focused on clarity over hype.

#### Voice Guidelines

- Speak with quiet confidence — never overpromise.
- Use verbs that imply construction or refinement (“build,” “craft,” “structure,” “refactor”).
- Avoid jargon unless context demands it; clarity is part of the brand.

---

### 🧱 Visual Aesthetic

**Motifs:**

- Nautical minimalism (lighthouse, beams, subtle grids)
- Blueprint and structure imagery
- Balance between hard geometry and soft light

**Layout Principles:**

- Prefer symmetry and alignment.
- Use grids (4px or 8px base).
- Keep whitespace generous.
- Contrast conveys clarity — dark navy with white or light gray is core.
