# Accessibility Testing Checklist

## Automated Testing

- [ ] Run axe-core browser extension on all pages
- [ ] Use WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
- [ ] Test with PA11Y command line tool

## Manual Testing

### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements in logical order
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- [ ] Test skip links (Tab to reveal, Enter to activate)
- [ ] Verify escape key works for closing modals/dropdowns
- [ ] Test arrow keys for navigation where appropriate

### Screen Reader Testing

- [ ] Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
- [ ] Verify all text content is announced correctly
- [ ] Check that status changes are announced (live regions)
- [ ] Ensure table structure is properly announced
- [ ] Verify form labels and error messages are read

### Visual Accessibility

- [ ] Test with high contrast mode enabled
- [ ] Verify color is not the only means of conveying information
- [ ] Check that focus indicators are visible in high contrast
- [ ] Test with 200% zoom to ensure usability
- [ ] Verify content reflows properly at different zoom levels

### Content Structure

- [ ] Check heading hierarchy (h1 â†’ h2 â†’ h3, no skipping)
- [ ] Verify landmarks are properly structured (nav, main, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure lists use proper markup (ul, ol, dl)
- [ ] Check that tables have captions and headers

## WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Points
